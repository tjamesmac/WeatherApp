# WeatherApp

This weather app was created with the intention of learning.

This was a chance to learn Typescript, webpack and newer JS features.

The majority of the code was in Typescript, my first time using it has been very insightful. There are lots of things left to learn to continue my progress.

Things to note so far are:
    Classes,
    Interfaces,
    Optional properties (?),
    Nested properties defined in the interface,
    Being unable to use certain types,
    Slow build times - possibly due to transpiling

In this project I set up my own webpack configuration to use whilst developing the project, the set up was pretty standard. The only addition to it is using Typescript as well.

    I used PostCSS and Saas to "style" this. There is minimal styling present due to it not being the focus of the project.

Using Async/Await was very interesting. Definitely helped with using Fetch.
